Description: Inventory management for DistKV
 =======
 DistInv
 =======
 .
 DistInv is a link between DistKV and your network infrastructure.
 .
 DistInv knows about hosts, ports, VLANs, (sub)networks, cables.
 .
 It stores
 * which VLAN a network is in
 * which network a host belongs to
 * which port is plugged into what
 * which groups a host belongs to
 * where a host is located
 .
 This allows you to
 * record which systems are where (surprisingly difficult â€¦)
 * auto-generate (part of) your Ansible inventory
 * display which VLANs need to be configured on a switch port
 * generate a network link path from A to B
